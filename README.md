# Static-Node-And-Express-Site

Node.js and Express make a powerful pair when used together on the server side, and are used everyday to make fast, modular and dynamic web applications.<br/>

For this project, I used Node.js, Express and Pug templates to create a portfolio site to show off the projects I have previously built. Showtime :space_invader:!
